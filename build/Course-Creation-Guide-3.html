                                            to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any
                                            way
                                            connected with your use of the Site or any Content, Apple’s liability shall
                                            in
                                            no event exceed the greater of (1) the total of any subscription or similar
                                            fees
                                            with respect to any service or feature of or on the Site paid in the six
                                            months
                                            prior to the date of the initial claim made against Apple (but not including
                                            the
                                            purchase price for any Apple hardware or software products or any AppleCare
                                            or
                                            similar support program), or (2) US$100.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow
                                            limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.
    
                                            Indemnity
                                            You agree to indemnify and hold Apple, its officers, directors,
                                            shareholders,
                                            predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and
                                            affiliates, harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses
                                            (including attorneys’ fees), made against Apple by any third party due to or
                                            arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site.
    
                                            Violation of These Terms of Use
                                            Apple may disclose any information we have about you (including your
                                            identity)
                                            if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any
                                            investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Site, or to identify,
                                            contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to
                                            or
                                            interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Apple’s rights
                                            or
                                            property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Site,
                                            including Apple’s customers. Apple reserves the right at all times to
                                            disclose
                                            any information that Apple deems necessary to comply with any applicable
                                            law,
                                            regulation, legal process or governmental request. Apple also may disclose
                                            your
                                            information when Apple determines that applicable law requires or permits
                                            such
                                            disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and
                                            organizations for fraud protection purposes.
    
                                            You acknowledge and agree that Apple may preserve any transmittal or
                                            communication by you with Apple through the Site or any service offered on
                                            or
                                            through the Site, and may also disclose such data if required to do so by
                                            law or
                                            Apple determines that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably
                                            necessary to
                                            (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce these Terms of Use, (3) respond
                                            to
                                            claims that any such data violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the
                                            rights, property or personal safety of Apple, its employees, users of or
                                            visitors to the Site, and the public.
    
                                            You agree that Apple may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice,
                                            terminate your access to the Site and/or block your future access to the
                                            Site if
                                            we determine that you have violated these Terms of Use or other agreements
                                            or
                                            guidelines which may be associated with your use of the Site. You also agree
                                            that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful
                                            and
                                            unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Apple, for
                                            which
                                            monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Apple obtaining any
                                            injunctive or equitable relief that Apple deems necessary or appropriate in
                                            such
                                            circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Apple
                                            may
                                            have at law or in equity.
    
                                            You agree that Apple may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice,
                                            terminate your access to the Site, for cause, which includes (but is not
                                            limited
                                            to) (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a
                                            request
                                            by you (self-initiated account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material
                                            modification of the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, or
                                            (4)
                                            unexpected technical issues or problems.
    
                                            If Apple does take any legal action against you as a result of your
                                            violation of
                                            these Terms of Use, Apple will be entitled to recover from you, and you
                                            agree to
                                            pay, all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of such action, in addition to
                                            any
                                            other relief granted to Apple. You agree that Apple will not be liable to
                                            you or
                                            to any third party for termination of your access to the Site as a result of
                                            any
                                            violation of these Terms of Use.
    
                                            Governing Law; Dispute Resolution
                                            You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site,
                                            including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States
                                            and by
                                            the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of laws
                                            provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state
                                            and
                                            federal courts in Santa Clara County, California, and waive any objection to
                                            such jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not
                                            apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a
                                            consumer
                                            based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the
                                            country
                                            where you reside. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within
                                            one
                                            (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action
                                            is
                                            barred. Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for
                                            goods and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be
                                            sought
                                            or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the
                                            prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event
                                            of
                                            any controversy or dispute between Apple and you arising out of or in
                                            connection
                                            with your use of the Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good
                                            faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such
                                            dispute
                                            within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party
                                            may
                                            submit such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be
                                            resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any
                                            right
                                            or remedy available to them under applicable law.
    
                                            Void Where Prohibited
                                            Apple administers and operates the www.apple.com Site from its location in
                                            Cupertino, California USA; other Apple sites may be administered and
                                            operated
                                            from various locations outside the United States. Although the Site is
                                            accessible worldwide, not all features, products or services discussed,

                                            outside the United States. Apple reserves the right to limit, in its sole
                                            discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature, product or service to
                                            any
                                            person or geographic area. Any offer for any feature, product or service
                                            made on
                                            the Site is void where prohibited. If you choose to access the Site from

                                            the United States, you do so on your own initiative and you are solely
                                            responsible for complying with applicable local laws.

                                            You may not use or export or re-export any Content or any copy or adaptation

                                            applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation United States

                                            If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or other
                                            tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such
                                            provisions
                                            shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced
                                            with
                                            a valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so
                                            that
                                            these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use
                                            constitute the entire agreement between you and Apple with regard to your
                                            use of
                                            the Site, and any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings
                                            previously existing between you and Apple with respect to such use are
                                            hereby
                                            superseded and cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you
                                            enter into with Apple, Apple will not accept any counter-offers to these
                                            Terms
                                            of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected. Apple’s
                                            failure
                                            to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not
                                            be
                                            construed as a waiver by Apple of any provision or any right it has to
                                            enforce
                                            these Terms of Use, nor shall any course of conduct between Apple and you or
                                            any
                                            other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These
                                            Terms
                                            of Use shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or
                                            remedies on
                                            any third parties.
    
                                            Apple provides access to Apple international data and, therefore, may
                                            contain
                                            references or cross references to Apple products, programs and services that
                                            are
                                            not announced in your country. Such reference does not imply that Apple in
                                            your
                                            country intends to announce such products, programs or services.
